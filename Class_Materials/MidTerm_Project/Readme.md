## Mid Term Project

The students can decide on their Midterm project to work on one of these two options:
1. Modeling project: Real estate modeling project (see the project folder). You can work on another project that you choose.
2. Business Intelligence Project: Olist Business Intellegince Project(see the project folder). 

You can also work on another project of your own choice. In that case you let us know about the the data set and the objective of the analysis.

### Rules:
- Group of maximum of two people per project. Eventhough it is not recommended, you can work alone on the project.
- Every team has 12 minutes(7 minutes presentation plus 5 minutes Q&A).
- Every team should prepare a well-documented and organised presentation. Although presenting only a Jupyter Notebook is acceptable, we encourage you to prepare additional slides for better story telling experience.

Notes:
- Please when choosing the data set for your project, please make sure to explore and investigate the data first to check if it is useful for your analysis. For instance:
  +  checking the number of rows(preferrably in thousands of observations)
  +  you need to check if it is full of missing values or not,
  +  checking the data type of the target variable(in case of modeling project)
  +  Also  in case of multiple tables or csv files, make sure that the data is joinable( meaning having matching keys to join the data between these tables).
  +  Important: checking if the target variable is a continuous(numerical) variable(then it is a regression task)  or it is discrete(categorical) then it is a classification task.
